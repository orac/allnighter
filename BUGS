“ ” could be better
¬ needs a bigger hook
6 and 9 are too square
Needs more glyphs:
  full Latin-1 coverage
  Euro sign
  superscripts and subscripts (digits and symbols)
  more arrows
  tall bracketing chars and semantic brackets
  number forms U+2153–2184 (not that important but easy)
  box drawing and block elements
  ≔ and ⩴
  turnstiles
  ringed and bracketed alnums
  Greek
  logical and set theoretic symbols ∧∨≡ etc.
  enclosed alnums U+2460–U+24b5 (if nothing else alias them to the plain alnums)
check for printability
doesn't look good at 12pt
could be more readable at 8pt
rasterisation of ░▒▓ could be better
fontconfig insists on substituting from an unsuitable font
add bold/italic
